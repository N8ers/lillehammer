This project was based off a local Indianapolis pizza shop and Norse mythology. 
This was a colaborative project with <a href="https://github.com/klcantrell" target="_blank">Kalalau Cantrell</a> in hopes to make a more interesting way to order your favorite pizzas. 
This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
